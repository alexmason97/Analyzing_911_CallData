# Analyzing_911_CallData
This notebook looks at analyzing some 911 call data from the city of Montgomery County in Pennsylvania. There are a few data visualizations, some data cleansing and some column and row manipulations as well. The .csv file is also available to view the entire dataset. This is a variation of a project from Jose Portilla's Python Data Science Bootcamp on Udemy.
